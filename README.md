# Arm MCP Server

This repository contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates:
- [migrate-ease](https://github.com/migrate-ease/migrate-ease) for scanning codebases
- [sysreport](https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/sysreport) for system information
- Docker image architecture checks
- A semantic search knowledge base (using USearch + embeddings)

The server is designed to run inside a Docker container and expose tools to MCP clients such as **q CLI** or **VS Code MCP integration**.

The Dockerfile is located in mcp-local.

embedding-generation is exclusively for creating the vector db, and mcp-remote is the IaC for AWS

---

## 1. Build the container

From the root of this project (where the `Dockerfile` lives):

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t arm-mcp .
```

To get into the container for troubleshooting, use

```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/bash arm-mcp
```

## 2. Set up the MCP config

### for q cli

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arm_torq": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-v", "[local directory path]:/workspace",
        "--name", "arm-mcp",
        "arm-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {},
      "timeout": 60000
    }
  }
}
```

Replace [local directory path] with the local path that you want the mcp server to be able to access.

For q cli this config should be placed in ~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json

### GitHub Copilot in VS Code

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "arm_torq": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-v", "[local directory path]:/workspace",
        "arm-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The config can either be put in:

`.vscode/mcp.json` local to the open project folder, or

globally here (for macOS):

`~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json`
