# Arm MCP Server

This repository contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates:
- [migrate-ease](https://github.com/migrate-ease/migrate-ease) for scanning codebases
- [sysreport](https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/sysreport) for system information
- Docker image architecture checks
- A semantic search knowledge base (using USearch + embeddings)

The server is designed to run inside a Docker container and expose tools to MCP clients such as **q CLI** or **VS Code MCP integration**.

The Dockerfile is located in mcp-local.

embedding-generation is exclusively for creating the vector db, and mcp-remote is the IaC for AWS

---

## 1. Build the container

From the root of this project, using the multi-stage Dockerfile in `mcp-local/`:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -f mcp-local/Dockerfile -t arm-mcp mcp-local
```

The command above will only build the Arm version. To build the multi-arch version and push to dockerhub:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 \
  -f mcp-local/Dockerfile \
  -t joestech324/mcp:arm-mcp-[version-number] \
  -t joestech324/mcp:latest \
  mcp-local --push
```

Where [version-number] is the current version.

To get into the container for troubleshooting, use

```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/bash arm-mcp
```

## 2. Set up the MCP config

### for q cli

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arm_torq": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-v", "[local directory path]:/workspace",
        "--name", "arm-mcp",
        "arm-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {},
      "timeout": 60000
    }
  }
}
```

Replace [local directory path] with the local path that you want the mcp server to be able to access.

For q cli this config should be placed in ~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json

### Codex CLI

```toml
[projects."/path/to/your/project"]
trust_level = "trusted"

[mcp_servers.arm_torq]
command = "docker"
args = [
  "run",
  "--rm",
  "-i",
  "-v", "[local directory path]:/workspace",
  "--name", "arm-mcp",
  "arm-mcp"
]
env = {}
```

Replace `[local directory path]` with the local path that you want the mcp server to be able to access, and replace `/path/to/your/project` with your actual project path.

For Codex CLI this config should be saved in `~/.codex/config.toml`.

### GitHub Copilot in VS Code

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "arm_torq": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-v", "[local directory path]:/workspace",
        "arm-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The config can either be put in:

`.vscode/mcp.json` local to the open project folder, or

globally here (for macOS):

`~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json`

The easiest way to open this file in VS Code for editing is command+shift+p and search for
